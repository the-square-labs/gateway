# Development Guide

[Back to README](../README.md)

Gateway is an Nx and pnpm monorepo with TypeScript app packages and Go daemon packages.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=24`
- pnpm `>=9`
- Go `>=1.24.4`
- Docker
- protoc

## Local Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start local infrastructure:

```bash
pnpm dev:infra
```

This starts Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, and the development internal registry from [docker-compose.dev.yml](../docker-compose.dev.yml). PostgreSQL is published on host port `55432` to avoid collisions with another local server.

Run migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

Start development servers:

```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

This starts backend, frontend, and status-page dev servers through Nx.

## Environment

Use [.env.example](../.env.example) as the local development reference.

Important local defaults:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://dev:dev@localhost:55432/gateway
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SETUP_BOOTSTRAP=false
WEB_TLS_BOOTSTRAP_MODE=http
```

Configure the canonical URL, authentication, and structured logging through the first-run wizard. For `pnpm dev:infra`, the bundled development ClickHouse can be selected as an external connection at `http://localhost:8123`; leaving structured logging disabled hides its product surfaces.

```

## Backend

The backend lives in `packages/backend`.

Main responsibilities:

- Hono HTTP API.
- OpenAPI documentation.
- OIDC authentication.
- Session handling.
- Permissions and scopes.
- OAuth and MCP.
- PostgreSQL persistence through Drizzle ORM.
- Redis-backed cache/session/rate-limit behavior.
- gRPC server for daemon control.
- Background jobs.
- WebSocket streams.

Useful paths:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `packages/backend/src/modules` | Feature modules and routes. |
| `packages/backend/src/db/schema` | Drizzle schema definitions. |
| `packages/backend/src/db/migrations` | SQL migrations. |
| `packages/backend/src/grpc` | gRPC server and generated TypeScript types. |
| `packages/backend/src/lib/scopes.ts` | Permission scope definitions and helpers. |

## Frontend

The frontend lives in `packages/frontend`.

Main stack:

- React 19.
- Vite.
- Tailwind CSS 4.
- shadcn-style UI components.
- Zustand stores.
- Vitest tests.

Useful paths:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `packages/frontend/src/pages` | Route-level pages. |
| `packages/frontend/src/components` | Shared and feature components. |
| `packages/frontend/src/stores` | Zustand stores. |
| `packages/frontend/src/services` | API and event-stream clients. |
| `packages/frontend/src/lib/scope-utils.ts` | Frontend scope editor helpers. |

## Daemons

Go daemons live under `packages/daemons`.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `packages/daemons/nginx` | nginx management daemon. |
| `packages/daemons/docker` | Docker management daemon. |
| `packages/daemons/monitoring` | metrics daemon. |
| `packages/daemons/relay` | remote Relay Pool supervisor. |
| `packages/daemons/secure-link-connector` | Docker-to-nginx Secure Link connector sidecar. |
| `packages/daemons/shared` | shared Go packages. |
| `packages/daemons/go.work` | Go workspace. |

The local public relay worker is a separate Go module under `packages/relay`; it is built, tested, vetted, versioned, and released independently from the node daemons.

Run daemon tests:

```bash
cd packages/daemons
go test ./docker/... ./monitoring/... ./nginx/... ./relay/... ./shared/... ./secure-link-connector/...
```

## Protobuf

Protobuf definitions live in `proto/`.

Regenerate stubs:

```bash
pnpm proto
```

Generated Go stubs are committed under `packages/daemons/shared/gatewayv1` and `packages/daemons/shared/relayv1`.

## Database Migrations

Generate a migration after schema changes:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

Apply migrations locally:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

Open Drizzle Studio:

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

## Verification

Common verification before submitting changes:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

For daemon-only changes:

```bash
pnpm proto
pnpm test:daemon
pnpm lint:daemon
```

Run `pnpm proto` whenever the Gateway daemon or Relay protobuf contracts change. The daemon update command schema is part of the signed update trust boundary, so keep generated Go stubs and backend TypeScript command types aligned.

For full release confidence:

```bash
pnpm build:all
```
