Gateway responsive header-action contract: use the shared ResponsiveHeaderActions component for page-level action groups. It must collapse to the Page actions ellipsis when the measured header width cannot retain at least 320px for the page title/content; a viewport-only breakpoint is insufficient because a desktop sidebar can reduce available content width. The component measures its header parent with ResizeObserver and keeps the command-palette registration unchanged. Verify the pure collapse threshold and a DOM case that forces a narrow header, plus frontend build and Biome.
