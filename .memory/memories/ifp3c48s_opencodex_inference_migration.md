# Managed inference-core integration contract

- Gateway owns the control plane: `gwi_` authentication, model/provider configuration, limits, pricing, and accounting.
- The managed inference core is a private runtime dependency reachable only over the internal service network; it must not publish a public port.
- The data plane is the stable transparent `/api/inference/v1/*` proxy with signed `wiolett-core/v1` context.
- Create the request/accounting row before signing context, and keep `rootRequestId` equal to that durable request ID.
- WebSocket proxying is per turn. Because the core socket may be multi-turn, Gateway closes the upstream socket after a terminal event so the client turn cannot hang.
- Hold the concurrency lease for the entire turn and release it only in finalization.
- Database mocks can hide missing persistence fields. Accounting regression tests must assert durable pricing snapshot linkage rather than only successful responses.
- Idempotent redelivery replays persisted admission decisions, including admitted output limits.
- Oversized responses that cannot be delivered to the client settle as failed rather than billing an undelivered success.
- Legacy harness-specific Codex, Anthropic, setup, and toggle routes are removed. Clients use discovery and the single stable inference prefix.
