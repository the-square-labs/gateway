Gateway human-readable main detail routes use this contract:
- Persist backend-generated collision-safe slugs (base limited to 60 characters before adding -1/-2 suffixes) only for nodes, database connections, proxy hosts, plus the existing logging environment/schema slug fields.
- Docker containers, deployments, and volumes use their exact case-sensitive names as the child route identity, scoped by node slug. Technical APIs, mutations, and popouts remain ID-based.
- Do not add slug systems for PKI, domains, certificates/ CAs, or templates unless separately requested. Frontend never computes canonical slugs.
- Slug rename events travel over the notification bus; the current tab updates from mutation responses and other tabs update from real-time while retaining their active tab.
- Route resolver requests must keep transient failures local (retry UI) rather than triggering global outage or rate-limit blockers; the resolved page context remains owner-safe for AI and command palette.
- Compact Docker node responses must be filtered client-side by requested Docker scope bases. Broad nodes:details access must not expand resource-scoped Docker authorization.

Reusable verification: full backend/frontend tests, lint/typecheck/build, git diff --check, migration against current and fresh PostgreSQL, authenticated browser smoke for all eight route families, transient resolver retry, two-tab node slug rename, and a Docker-only scoped user.
