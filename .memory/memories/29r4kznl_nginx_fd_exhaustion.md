Gateway nginx ingress file-descriptor exhaustion hardening:

- If Nginx begins returning broad HTTP failures and logs `accept4()`, `socket()`, or `open()` with errno 24, inspect both the worker process open-file limit and `events.worker_connections`.
- The managed Gateway Nginx provisioning/template should set `worker_rlimit_nofile 65535` and `worker_connections 8192` so workers do not inherit a low service limit.
- Validate generated configuration with `nginx -t` and apply it with a graceful reload.
- Verify the new worker limits and representative proxy, configuration, and static-asset requests after reload.
- Treat direct host edits as emergency mitigation only: package or base-configuration updates can overwrite them, so the durable fix belongs in Gateway-owned provisioning/templates.
