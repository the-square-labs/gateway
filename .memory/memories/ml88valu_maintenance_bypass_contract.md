Managed proxy maintenance bypass exposes a session-level boolean at GET /_gateway/maintenance-access/status while the capability-backed maintenance guard is active. Nginx derives {"active":true|false} from its existing secure_link validation, returns no-store JSON, and never exposes or forwards the HttpOnly bypass cookies. This signal proves only that the current browser has a valid host-bound bypass session; it does not identify a Gateway user and must not be treated as application authentication. In legacy maintenance mode without daemon capability, the status endpoint is intentionally absent.
