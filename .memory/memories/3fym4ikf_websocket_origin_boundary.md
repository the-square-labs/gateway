Gateway WebSocket cookie authentication must not trust localhost or local-interface hosts as a broad Origin class. In production, accept the canonical public `APP_URL` origin, or for direct domainless Gateway access only the exact origin of the WebSocket target resolved from the upgrade request, including scheme, host, and port. A page served from another local port must not be able to open the authenticated Gateway WebSocket merely because both endpoints are local. Bearer Authorization credentials remain independent of this cookie-Origin predicate. The enforcement helper and regression coverage live in `packages/backend/src/app.ts` and `packages/backend/src/app.host-guard.test.ts`.
