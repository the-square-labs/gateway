# Gateway Onboarding, AI Workspace, and Interface Contract

## Finalize Setup and Browser Setup

- Finalize Setup is a terminal per-step checklist, not a dismissible dashboard notice.
- Version 3 raw steps are `nodes`, `ai_workspace`, `cloudflare`, `gitlab`, `mfa`, and `invite_users`.
- Gateway Inference is nested in the shared AI Workspace flow and is not a root checklist step. Normalize legacy `ai_assistant` to `ai_workspace`; legacy `inference` does not gate completion.
- The Integrations row is complete only when both Cloudflare and GitLab have outcomes. `Skip for now` closes without changing outcomes; `Finish` is available only after all raw steps have outcomes.
- Browser Setup applies core configuration first, persists phase `ai_workspace`, and remains incomplete until AI Workspace is configured or explicitly skipped.
- Reuse `ConfigureAIWorkspaceWizard` in Browser Setup, Finalize Setup, and the installation-owner interface chooser. Do not create a separate persistent sidebar CTA.
- The wizard supports an OpenAI-compatible provider or Gateway Inference. Show Inference only when the caller has every required management scope.
- Setup-purpose sessions are bounded to the active setup session, are never refreshed, are omitted from public session lists, are restricted to required setup endpoints, and are revoked on completion.
- `/api/ai/status` remains in the setup-purpose allowlist because setup refreshes provider state after saving.

## AI Workspace and Gateway Inference Scopes

- `ai:workspace:use` is the dedicated AI Workspace access scope.
- The built-in `viewer`, `operator`, `admin`, and `system-admin` groups receive `ai:workspace:use` by default. `guest` does not.
- `feat:ai:use` remains the separate Gateway Inference and personal inference-usage scope. It must never substitute for AI Workspace access.
- Existing groups and user-specific grants that had `feat:ai:use` before the split are migrated to also receive `ai:workspace:use`, preserving prior AI Workspace access without granting the new scope to programmatic tokens.
- AI Workspace browser routes, WebSocket authorization, embedded AI tools, provider shell state, connector handoffs, command palette actions, sidebar AI controls, and personal AI approval controls use `ai:workspace:use`.
- Gateway Inference management/data-plane access, inference tokens, model access, personal usage, usage cards, and inference endpoint preferences remain on `feat:ai:use` and their operation-specific inference scopes.

## Interface Choice and Navigation

- Persist each user's `preferredInterface` as `ai_workspace` or `operations_console`, with a server timestamp. Clear local preference state while another user's preference is loading.
- Users without `ai:workspace:use` never see the first-run interface chooser. Gateway immediately applies and persists `operations_console`, including when a stale stored preference says `ai_workspace`.
- Users without the Workspace scope do not see Workspace actions in Sidebar, Command Palette, or Profile. Direct `/ai/chats/:conversationId` access redirects to `/profile`.
- Users with `ai:workspace:use` see the non-dismissible chooser when AI Workspace is configured. The installation owner may configure Workspace through the same chooser.
- Choosing AI Workspace opens the shared setup flow and saves the preference only after successful setup.
- Sidebar may show the existing scoped `AIButton`, but must not contain a separate full-width or expand `Open AI Workspace` CTA.
- Product terms are AI Workspace, Operations Console, and Work Session. AI Workspace is recommended and intent-driven; Operations Console remains complete without AI.

## AI Side Panel Transition

- When switching from AI Workspace to Operations Console, automatically open the AI side panel only if the active persisted Work Session has content and at least one user-authored message or attachment.
- An empty chat, an assistant-only welcome state, a draft without a persisted conversation, or a session that was merely opened and closed must not auto-open the side panel.
- Manual AI panel opening and an already active meaningful Work Session remain unchanged.

## Dashboard Fallback

- Dashboard availability and routing must use the same `hasDashboardContent` contract as Sidebar visibility.
- If Dashboard is absent from Sidebar, both `/` in Operations Console and `/dashboard` redirect to `/profile`.
- Profile remains universally available for authenticated users.
- Dashboard and Sidebar continue to share the deduplicated `POST /api/monitoring/dashboard/bootstrap` Zustand snapshot; do not create a parallel dashboard authorization model.

## Scenario, Work Session, and Resource Handoffs

- Missing connectors or Gateway-managed nodes are setup decisions, not terminal scenario blockers. Use `open_connector_setup` and `open_node_enrollment` and return the outcome to the same conversation.
- Do not route an in-progress scenario into the global Finalize Setup checklist.
- AI resource links use backend-issued canonical `uiHref` and `workspaceEmbeddable`; never derive Gateway routes from model text.
- Terminal Work Session state stays in hidden assistant messages with `conversationStatus` and optional `blockReason`; do not add conversation columns for this state.

## Gateway Inference Boundary

- Gateway Inference is a standalone bounded context with `/api/inference/v1`, dedicated `gwi_` tokens, isolated credentials/runtime, persisted feature flags, and separate Settings/Profile surfaces.
- Administration is under Settings > Inference. Personal usage and inference-token management are under Profile.
- The embedded Assistant may expose permission-aware inference management tools, but Gateway Inference remains excluded from remote Gateway MCP.

## Verification

- Keep backend scope definitions, built-in group defaults, migration compatibility, frontend scope metadata, AI route guards, chooser behavior, Sidebar/Profile visibility, Dashboard routing, internal docs, and tests synchronized.
- Verify with targeted backend/frontend tests, backend typecheck, frontend production build, scoped Biome, and `git diff --check`.
