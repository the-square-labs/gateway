Gateway's resetClientSessionState clears interfacePreferenceLoaded when authContextKey changes (user ID, sorted scopes, blocked state). RealtimeBridge's getUserPreferences effect must track that same auth context, not only user.id: live scope updates keep the ID unchanged, so an ID-only effect never reloads preferences and DashboardLayout remains on its blank Loading workspace gate on / or AI conversation routes. Reuse stores/auth.ts authContextKey for preference loading and route identity; keep the existing cancellation cleanup to discard old-context preference responses and failure hydration to unblock the UI. Regression coverage should drive permissions.changed.<userId> through RealtimeBridge with the real session reset callback, covering grant/revoke, failed preference fetch, in-flight old response, and unchanged/reordered scopes.
