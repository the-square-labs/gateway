Gateway's "Add inference model" dialog fills Display name, context window, max input/output tokens, modalities, capabilities, reasoning efforts, pricing and the Auto-compaction limit from the known catalog in packages/backend/src/modules/inference/providers/inference-provider-model-catalog.ts.

- ANTHROPIC_MODELS (shared by providerId 'anthropic' and 'anthropic-apikey') maps an upstream model id to claudeModel(displayName, maxInputTokens, maxOutputTokens, inputPrice, outputPrice, cachedInputPrice = inputPrice * 0.1). claudeModel derives autoCompactTokenLimit via compactLimit(maxInputTokens) and sets capabilities { reasoning, tools, vision } = true.
- When a model id is absent from the catalog, discovery-only metadata leaves the dialog showing "REASONING/TOOLS/VISION UNAVAILABLE" and "Auto-compaction limit: Not reported by the provider; enter a value to continue", which blocks Add model. Adding the catalog row is enough to unblock it.
- knownProviderModel() lowercases the id and also tries an undated key by stripping a trailing -YYYY-MM-DD or -NNNN, so a version-suffixed id such as claude-opus-5-5 needs its own exact key.
- Anthropic adaptive-thinking detection in inference-provider-wire.ts uses the regex /claude-(?:fable|mythos|sonnet|opus)-5(?:\b|-)/, and model-scoped quota families in inference-core/inference-core-provider-map.ts match on the family substring, so point releases of an existing family need no change there.
- Precedent commit: e27e8743 "fix(inference): read subscription quota per core account and know Claude 5.1".
