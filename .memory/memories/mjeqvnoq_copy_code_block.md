`CopyCodeBlock` must retain `overflow-hidden` on its bordered grid container so its scrollable code pane and right-side copy action remain visually contained by the outer border. The copy action pane keeps its own `border-l border-input`; do not add stacking that can visually cover the divider. In the inference onboarding default-model row, explicitly override SettingsControlRow's desktop intrinsic control width with `sm:w-full sm:min-w-0 sm:max-w-[20rem]` so a Select remains within the dialog/panel rather than expanding with its content. Verify these UI layout changes with frontend Biome, production build, and git diff --check.
