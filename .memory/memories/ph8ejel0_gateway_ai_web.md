Gateway AI web_search contract (implementation in `packages/backend/src/modules/ai/ai.web-search.ts`, extracted from ai.service.ts in June 2026; re-verified 2026-10-01):
- Tavily receives `api_key` in the JSON body together with `search_depth: 'basic'`, not as an Authorization header.
- SearXNG uses `/search?q=...&format=json&pageno=1` without categories and needs no API key, but requires a base URL; a missing base URL or one pointing to a private address returns a tool error.
- Providers other than SearXNG without credentials return the result error 'Web search is not configured. An admin must set up the web search API key.' rather than throwing.
