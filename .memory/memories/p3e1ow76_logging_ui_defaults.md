Gateway logging and housekeeping UI contract updated on 2026-08-28:

- Logging list and Page Project detail headers do not show redundant plan/type badges. License enforcement remains in feature access and API behavior, not decorative page-title badges.
- Logging environment creation uses example placeholders for Name and Description.
- Every Logging environment header exposes Connection instructions. The dialog has SDK and API tabs and must reuse shared Dialog, Tabs, AnimatedHeight, and CopyCodeBlock primitives. SDK examples use @sqgateway/logger; API examples use Bearer ingest tokens with /api/logging/ingest and mention /api/logging/ingest/batch.
- Housekeeping defaults enable Structured Logs and Orphaned Volumes when settings are absent.
- ClickHouse Internals defaults enabled only when the persisted logging storage mode is local (Gateway-managed). It defaults disabled for external or missing storage ownership because cleanup targets ClickHouse system log tables that may be shared.
- Gateway Logs remains false because that storage category is unavailable.
- Existing persisted housekeeping values remain authoritative; defaults apply only when a setting is missing.
- Housekeeping run history uses the existing MAX_HISTORY cap of 20 both when saving and when returning history, so legacy oversized persisted arrays are bounded at the backend boundary.
- Helper/footer text shown in Settings for registry token authority and Housekeeping last-run/history controls uses the standard 14px text-sm size.
