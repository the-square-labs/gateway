In /Users/knownout/Projects/wiolett/gateway, AI chat terminal state is represented by hidden assistant messages with conversationStatus "ended" or "context_blocked" plus blockReason, not by ai_conversations columns. end_conversation/context_blocked runtime events must persist that marker, snapshots must derive status from the UI messages themselves, frontend normalization must preserve conversationStatus/blockReason or synthesize a marker from conversation.status, and startUserRun should reject new user turns when a recent marker says the conversation is ended or context-blocked. Useful regression checks: backend ai-run-executor and ai-run.service tests, backend ai.ws test, frontend ai-conversation-persistence store test, frontend/backend tsc, biome on touched files, git diff --check.
