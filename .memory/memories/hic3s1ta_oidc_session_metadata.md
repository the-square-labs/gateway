Gateway OIDC session metadata: audit logging resolves client IP and User-Agent from the incoming callback request, but browser-session records must receive the same metadata explicitly. Auth routes should call AuthService.handleCallback with getClientIpForContext(c) and c.req.header('user-agent'); AuthService must pass { authMethod: 'oidc', ipAddress, userAgent } to SessionService.createSession. Do not backfill older sessions from audit entries: there is no reliable session-to-audit linkage. The profile presents known browser/platform labels derived from stored User-Agent; existing sessions remain Unknown until the user signs in again.
