Gateway frontend design-system migration contract:
- Migrate explicitly scoped screens from legacy @/components/ui/*, native presentation elements, and page-level className/style overrides to @wiolett/design-system props and generic components. DS internals may use className/style; technical ref/sentinel/measurement elements may remain where no DS surface is appropriate.
- Keep application behavior, data fetching, routing, API state, and domain mappings in frontend consumers. Do not create page-specific DS components such as SettingsRow and do not move AI-assistant-specific UI into DS unless separately requested.
- Completed migration areas include Settings, Administration (users, groups, audit log and modals), and Notifications.

Component choices:
- Use Stack/FlexLayout/GridLayout, Card/CardBody/CardContent/CardSection/CardFooter, FormRow, SurfaceGrid, BoundedStack, PageContent/PageHeader, ListRow, Field, DetailRow, KeyValueEditor, InlineCode/CodeBlock, and DS Dialog APIs.
- Table is for small non-virtualized lists with content-sized columns. DataTable owns large virtualized lists and aligned sticky headers; grid tracks use minmax(0, ...) so columns can shrink.
- CodeMirror consumers use DS CodeEditor. Multi-step wizards may keep application state, AnimatePresence, and measurement wrappers around DS surfaces.
- Add missing variants as generic additive DS props/axes and document them in a dedicated *.stories.tsx for each exported public component; do not create grouped or app-specific stories.
- Settings-specific layout/parity belongs in generic DS density/alignment/control-width props, not local CSS escape hatches. Application-specific modals and mappings remain local.

Styling:
- Do not rely on arbitrary Tailwind utilities inside the package for required surface/state colors. Prefer stable DS classes and explicit declarations.
- Keep global resets such as border-color inside the base cascade layer so frontend CSS imported after DS does not override primitive states.

Verification:
- Run DS lint/typecheck/test/build/build-storybook and the touched frontend lint/typecheck/test/build.
- Check exported DS components against story files and scan migrated screens for legacy imports or unapproved className/style/native presentation elements.
- Browser-compare the real application flow as well as Storybook because frontend CSS order can differ from Storybook.
