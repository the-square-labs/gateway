In the Gateway repository, the AI system prompt/retrieval contract is enterprise-grade rather than MVP: at the first substantive request in a new conversation and whenever the user explicitly asks about previous work, the assistant must search previous chats in both the current retrieval boundary and all_user_chats before answering. Project chats should inject project pointers plus lightweight tail context for up to 3 recent project chats; remaining chats are pointers/on-demand via search_chats/find_in_chat/read_chat_slice. Tail snippets are not authoritative evidence; exact claims require read_chat_slice. Prompt rules should strongly require discover_tools before claiming a Gateway tool is unavailable and internal_documentation before complex/recent/permission-sensitive workflows.
