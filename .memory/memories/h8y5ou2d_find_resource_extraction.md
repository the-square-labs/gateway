Gateway AI `find_resource` implementation lives in `packages/backend/src/modules/ai/ai.resource-search.ts` (moved out of ai.service.ts in June 2026) and is reached through the public executeTool path. Current behaviour, re-verified 2026-10-01 (the June notes about "query is required" and list_proxy_hosts are outdated):
- A call with neither `query` nor `types` is rejected ("query or types is required").
- Each resource type is searched only when the caller holds its base scope (e.g. `proxy:view`, `proxy:templates:view`), by delegating to the ordinary list tools through `executeToolInternal` (proxy hosts via `list_routes` with the search term, templates via `manage_proxy_template` list, CAs via `list_cas`, and so on), so results never exceed what the caller could list directly.
- Docker resources are searched per allowed Docker node derived from resource-scoped grants.
