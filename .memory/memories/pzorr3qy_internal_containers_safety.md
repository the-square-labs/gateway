Gateway-owned implementation containers are identified by explicit labels and filtered only at the public Docker presentation boundary. Current internal markers include wiolett.gateway.managed=secure-link-connector, wiolett.gateway.managed-database.connector=true, net.wiolett.gateway.managed=clickhouse plus net.wiolett.gateway.owner=gateway, com.wiolett.gateway.managed-service, and gateway.sandbox=true. Public container lists, aggregate snapshots, dashboard pins, GPU usage, compose/webhook consumers, and AI list tools use the filtered inventory. Internal safety-sensitive operations such as image cleanup and Docker migration preflight must use DockerManagementService.listAllContainers so service containers still count as running/in-use and are not damaged. Do not filter the persisted daemon snapshot or daemon reconciliation itself.
