Root cause: Some backend routes return legacy error bodies as { error: string } instead of the standard { code, message }. This caused UI to surface blank toasts during failures (e.g., Docker image pull-sync on container deploy) because ApiClientBase only reads the message field. Fix pattern: Normalize routes toward AppError / { code, message }. Make ApiClientBase resilient by falling back to the error field when message is missing or blank. Normalize Docker daemon dispatch failures by preferring a non-empty error, then detail, then a fallback message, so empty daemon responses never surface as blank UI errors. Verification steps: reproduce with invalid image refs and empty daemon responses; confirm UI shows a meaningful error; confirm ApiClientBase gracefully handles missing message; regression tests for both paths. Gotchas: ensure new error shapes are backward compatible with existing clients; update any client parsing logic and tests to prefer { code, message } while maintaining fallback paths. Durable outcomes: consistent error schemas across routes, resilient client parsing, and clear user-facing error messages during deploy failures.
