Gateway supports Claude Code CLI through `npx -y @sqgateway/inference@latest setup claude-code`; Claude Code 2.1.129 or newer is required.

- Setup issues a dedicated `gwi_` runtime token, validates Gateway model discovery and native Anthropic streaming, and stores the credential in the operating-system credential store.
- Claude settings receive package-owned `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, gateway model discovery, and an `apiKeyHelper`; the token itself is never written to the settings file.
- Gateway models use stable `claude-gateway-*` aliases accepted by Claude Code. Default Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku selections map to available Gateway models, while users may select any discovered alias.
- Merge settings atomically, preserve unrelated values, restore exact previous values on removal, and stop if a package-owned value was subsequently edited.
- The interactive manager reports, diagnoses, repairs, and removes Codex and Claude Code integrations independently.
- This integration configures Claude Code CLI only. Claude Desktop and the VS Code extension have separate configuration surfaces and are not modified automatically.
