PKCS#12 export via node-forge fails for Gateway-issued ECDSA leaves because its X.509 parser only supports RSA public-key OIDs. Use OpenSSL in Gateway runtime images for PKCS#12 creation and pass private key, certificate, optional intermediate chain, and passphrase through dedicated child-process file descriptors; never persist plaintext key material or include it in argv/environment/logs. Key-bearing certificate exports (`private-key`, PEM bundle, PKCS#12, JKS) must reuse resource-scoped `pki:cert:export`, write a redacted `cert.export_key` audit event with only format metadata, and fail closed when `AuditService.log()` returns false. PEM bundle semantics: certificate.pem + private-key.pem + optional intermediate-only chain.pem + leaf-first fullchain.pem.
