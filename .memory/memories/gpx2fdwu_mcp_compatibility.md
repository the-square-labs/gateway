Gateway Assistant guidance for Gateway Inference setup:

- For Gateway Inference setup the embedded Assistant reads the internal inference documentation first.
- If `get_gateway_settings` is available, it reports whether `generalSettings.features.inferenceEnabled` is enabled before giving setup instructions. Without `settings:gateway:view` it must not guess the installation state and should tell the user that an administrator must confirm it.
- Setup guidance uses the `@sqgateway/inference` package (`packages/gateway-inference`), discovery, and the single stable `/api/inference/v1` contract; do not reference removed harness-specific endpoint toggles.

The MCP `mcp:extended_compatibility` opt-out setting (absent = enabled, eager `tools/list`) is specified in the MCP tool exposure and discovery memory; keep Settings copy, Assistant documentation and the `update_gateway_settings` tool description synchronized with it.
