# Gateway Codex companion lifecycle

- `@sqgateway/inference` configures Codex through `setup codex` and never shadows or replaces the system `codex` executable.
- The experimental Desktop/CLI usage wrappers are removed. Current setup cleans package-owned legacy wrapper artifacts automatically.
- `uninstall codex-usage` remains an ownership-aware offline cleanup command for affected historical installations and preserves the base Codex integration, runtime token, catalog, MCP, and proxy.
- Codex usage and quota displays remain native; Gateway limits are shown in Gateway UI.
- Gateway inference uses the stable `/api/inference/v1` prefix, dedicated `gwi_` credentials, and a feature toggle persisted in Gateway settings.
- Codex setup uses the official account login state plus Gateway-owned runtime credentials, installs a private helper/proxy, refreshes the model catalog, and preserves unrelated Codex configuration.
- Catalog validation rejects invalid `web_search_tool_type`, preserves the last-good catalog, and advertises hosted-search capability accurately.
- Companion state is scoped per resolved Codex configuration home. Shared runtime credentials/catalog state are removed only after the final managed home is detached.
- Cleanup, diagnostics, and staging validation must not alter user-owned provider configuration or quota.
