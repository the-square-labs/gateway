Gateway threshold notification alerts track state with composite resource IDs; render labels must be derived separately from those state IDs (`packages/backend/src/modules/notifications/notification-evaluator.service.ts`, `getThresholdResourceName`, verified 2026-10-01).

- Node disk alerts use composite IDs like `nodeId:/`; on firing, notifications must use the node hostname/name as resource.name, not the raw mount `/`, otherwise Discord templates render `Resource: node//`.
- Container metric alerts use composite IDs like `nodeId:containerName`; on resolve, notifications must keep the container name rather than switching to the node name.
- Database metric alerts must keep the database display name on resolve instead of falling back to the database ID.
- Fix pattern: pass the raw source/name into the clear handling and derive render names through getThresholdResourceName, preserving raw sources/names for final labels. (The original regression test file was removed by the 2026-09-29 light-suite cut.)
