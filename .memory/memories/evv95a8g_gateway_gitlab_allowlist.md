In the Gateway repository, GitLab connector edit UI should not fetch available projects directly from GitLab on modal open or during edit search. Existing connector project options are backend-cached in integration_connector_projects and exposed via GET /api/integrations/gitlab/connectors/:id/allowlist/options. Manual refresh is explicit via POST /api/integrations/gitlab/connectors/:id/allowlist/options/refresh, which calls provider.listProjects, persists projects with persistProjects, audits connector.gitlab.project.list, and returns cached options. New connector creation should persist the initial project list so later edit opens from cache. Edit-mode search filters the cached options locally; create-mode preview search can still use the submitted PAT.
