Gateway Secure Link migration and deployment-safety rules:

- Install compatible daemon versions before cutover and preserve node identities and stateful foundation services. Check upgrade compatibility for every participating daemon endpoint before relay cutover.
- Deployment procedures inspect ownership before replacing services, preserve stateful foundation services and their credentials, use signed immutable artifacts, and fail closed on incompatible or unavailable artifacts.
- Under the per-link migration lock, reread the proxy/link row before writing cutover state so stale snapshots cannot reset a completed or ready transition.
- Prove cutover by showing the old direct path is no longer required, while ensuring cleanup is automatically reversed after the test.
- During self-update, recreate the app before the relay where required and tolerate only bounded transient unhealthy states.
- Installer scripts fail closed when the requested daemon artifact cannot be downloaded; never retain a mismatched existing binary silently.
- Public proxy APIs expose only the stable `secureLinkActive` boolean and continue stripping internal Secure Link ports and status details.
- Release candidates use immutable digest references, and relay build identity must match the configured Gateway relay build version; otherwise supervision must report an image/contract mismatch.
- Migration verification must cover workload continuity, persisted database state, proxy behavior, node reconnect, and absence of unexpected workload restarts, without persisting host-specific topology in memory.
