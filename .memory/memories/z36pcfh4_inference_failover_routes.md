Gateway Inference runtime candidate-selection contract:

- The model administration UI account count represents persisted enabled source bindings; it does not prove every binding survives the data-plane eligibility query.
- A configured, enabled, non-deleted, core-backed source remains a routing candidate across transient discovery omissions.
- Discovery availability is catalog freshness, not authoritative request-time reachability.
- Keep capability compatibility, source/connection enablement, deletion state, and core-link validity as hard filters.
- If the core or upstream rejects a model, response-level failover owns excluding that connection and trying the next eligible candidate.
- Regression coverage must include transient discovery omission with healthy alternate bindings, reserve thresholds, upstream rejection, and multi-candidate failover.
