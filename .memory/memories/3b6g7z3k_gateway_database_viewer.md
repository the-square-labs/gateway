Gateway PostgreSQL viewer contract (the backend implementation now lives in the private gateway-commercial repo under backend/databases; the frontend viewer is in this repo):
- Row edits must not rely on frontend-only coercion. The backend must cast insert/update/delete parameters by column metadata, including numeric, date, timestamp, JSON, and USER-DEFINED enum types using the correct schema/name.
- Send only changed-column deltas for edits; do not rewrite a whole row from the original frontend clone.
- Map only user-actionable PostgreSQL query failures (constraint, type, invalid input, and similar client-correctable errors) to AppError 400 / DATABASE_QUERY_FAILED with a useful message.
- Do not blanket-map every driver error carrying SQLSTATE or metadata to 400. Operational failures such as shutdowns or server-side availability problems must remain higher-level/server errors.
- Verify frontend row-edit behaviour and the backend cast/delta/error-classification paths in gateway-commercial.
