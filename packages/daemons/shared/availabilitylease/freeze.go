// Freeze detection from peer time (D4).
//
// A VM that its hypervisor pauses (or RAM-snapshots) does not see the pause on
// any of its own clocks: CLOCK_BOOTTIME, CLOCK_MONOTONIC and the wall clock
// all stand still, and the wall clock is stepped later by NTP, minutes after
// the resume or never. The wall clock is therefore never evidence of a freeze
// (a step fenced a lease acquired minutes after a resume, stand run B-7).
//
// The evidence is the peers' lease clocks. Every batch carries the sender's
// lease clock and its origin (BootOrigin), plus an echo of the destination's
// own clock from the newest batch the sender received from it and how long it
// held that batch. The receiver keeps, per sender, the offset between its own
// lease clock and the sender's. Without a freeze that offset only grows with
// message delay and moves slowly with clock rate drift; when this host lost d
// of local time since the sender's previous frame it drops by d.
//
// Only batches whose delay the echo bounds by a short round trip
// (maxBoundedRTT) form the reference: the lowest of their offsets over the
// last freezeWindow of local time, less a drift allowance. Any batch is then
// tested against it, and a drop beyond the skew budget is a freeze of this
// host. Because the reference is at most one short round trip above the true
// offset, frames held up anywhere (a stalled stream, a relay queue, a replay)
// can never look like a freeze: they only raise offsets. Offsets that grow (a
// peer that froze, rebooted or restarted with a new origin) are never
// evidence either.
//
// On the first detection of a freeze every lease this node holds may have been
// held across it: its budget ran on a clock that lost d. Those keys fence at
// once (FenceFrozen) with their deadlines moved back by d, so the stop grace
// and the watchdog record follow real time; rounds in flight are dropped and
// observations taken before the detection discarded. The relay gate stays
// closed for every accept anchored before the detection until this node
// promises afresh. Every sender's window is then shifted by d, so the first
// frames from the other peers, which show the same drop, are explained by the
// known freeze and change nothing: leases acquired after a detected freeze are
// never fenced for it. Freezes shorter than the budget stay inside the timing
// margins of the lease term (doc.go).
