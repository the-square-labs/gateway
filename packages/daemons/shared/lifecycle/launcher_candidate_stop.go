// A launcher stops an update candidate on trial that does not prove itself
// (no local readiness, no Gateway control readiness) and starts the previous
// daemon again at once. That previous daemon (2.11.4-rc.6 or later) takes
// over connections handed to it like the next process of an update does, so
// a candidate stopped on trial hands its connections over too: a rollback
// keeps the streams the candidate took over and opened, instead of cutting
// them and leaving the restored daemon to find their peers reset. A stop of
// the whole service (the keeper stops with it) loses that handover, which
// costs nothing over the cut it replaces.

// candidateStopHandsOver reports whether this daemon is an update candidate
// still on trial whose previous daemon takes a handover over.
