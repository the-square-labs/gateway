// Package handover hands a daemon's live connections to its next process when
// it exits for an update (live handover, LH): the relay stream sessions
// (relayresume) it carries for local sockets, and the node-local link
// connections it copies between two local sockets.
//
// Before the process exits, every bridge stops at a point where each byte is
// either in its session or in the local socket (the stream freezes: the
// session hands the bridge nothing more and takes whatever it read). The local
// sockets go to the launcher's keeper (listenerkeep, as "conn/<n>"), and the
// sessions' state goes along in a sealed memory file ("state/handover"). The
// next process takes the snapshot once, before it registers anything with the
// relays, takes the sockets, drops the keeper's copies at once, and carries
// the streams on: a source resumes on a new path, a target waits for its
// source's RESUME, as after the loss of a path. For the peer and the local
// socket, the update is a pause.
//
// The handover commits when the snapshot reached the keeper; until then every
// bridge thaws and carries on in this process if anything fails, and the
// daemon drains as before. Once committed the old process never touches a
// handed over stream again, so a stream is carried by exactly one process: a
// crash of the next one before it took the snapshot leaves it to the rolled
// back binary; one after it cuts the streams, but never duplicates or loses a
// byte.
//
// What is not handed over is cut as before: raw streams of peers without
// RSv1, connections whose bytes the daemon itself transforms (TLS), a stream
// still in its handshake, and what does not fit the keeper (MaxConnections).
// An update that restarts the whole service for a newer launcher (one whose
// launcher predates self-update, lifecycle.ServiceRestartPending) hands
// nothing over: the launcher and what it keeps stop too.
