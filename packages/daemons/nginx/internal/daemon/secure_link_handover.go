// A restart or update of the nginx daemon hands its Secure Link sockets over
// to the next daemon process instead of closing them (B-13). The listener
// keeper (the daemon launcher, and systemd's file descriptor store) holds a
// copy of every listening socket, so the socket keeps accepting connections
// into its backlog while no daemon process runs; the next process adopts it
// and serves them.
//
// The next process can only start once this one exited (systemctl restart
// stops the unit before it starts it again), so the stopping process keeps
// accepting while it lets the requests it serves finish. It stops accepting
// only at the end, gives the requests it accepted last a short moment, and
// exits: a new connection waits in the backlog for the restart itself, not for
// the drain as well (1.7 s and two client timeouts at 50 rps).
//
// Until the sockets are handed over, a connection that sits idle between
// requests stays open: nginx reuses it, and this process serves it. Ending it
// gains nothing, since nginx's next connection reaches this process as well,
// and a connection ended at the moment nginx takes it from its keep-alive pool
// fails the request sent on it. nginx retries such a request on the next
// member of an Availability upstream, which lists every member twice (once as
// a backup) and tries each entry once: with the other member down, the retry
// takes the next pooled connection to the same socket, ended in the same pass,
// and the request fails with a 502. Ending idle connections on every tick of
// the restart hold (up to 8 s) did exactly that.
//
// Once the sockets are handed over, a connection is closed as soon as it
// answered and stayed silent briefly: nginx sends its next request on it only
// after the whole answer, and under load it does so faster than the idle quiet,
// so its connections stayed open until the exit cut them. A connection cut
// that way while it sits in nginx's keep-alive pool fails the retry of a
// request cut with it at once, and nginx tries each member of an Availability
// upstream (all of them sockets of this daemon) once per request: a 502.
// Ending them can still meet a request nginx sends at that moment, so a drain
// pass ends one per socket, the one silent longest: nginx takes the connection
// it pooled last first, a request meets at most one ended connection to a
// socket, and its retry gets a live one or a new connection that waits for the
// next process.
//
// A connection that has not reached its relay tunnel yet (its opener holds it
// because the target's daemon announced a restart, or a relay or the target is
// not back yet, or the relay has not answered the tunnel yet) has sent nothing
// to nginx, and nginx does not retry a single upstream: cutting it is a 502.
// The handover therefore waits for such connections to reach their target,
// serving and accepting meanwhile, up to the restart hold. A Route whose node
// restarts while this daemon updates (Update Nodes) is served once the node
// registered again instead of failing on this process's exit.
//
// A drain ends a connection with a shutdown, not a close: nginx sees it end at
// once, and the opener closes it when its tunnel ended. A close waits for the
// goroutines reading and writing the connection to let go of it, and a busy
// daemon on one CPU runs them tens of milliseconds later each: a drain pass
// closing a handful of connections took 0.1 s, and the bounded wait after the
// handover took 0.5-1 s instead of 0.3 s while new connections waited in the
// backlog.
