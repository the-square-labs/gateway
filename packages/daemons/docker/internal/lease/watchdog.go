// Watchdog liveness has two thresholds (A12.4).
//
// Fresh (heartbeat age <= leasefence.HeartbeatMaxAge, 3 s) gates everything
// that begins something: acquiring, starting a container, the backend gate
// and candidacy. A late heartbeat only delays these.
//
// Lost (age > leasefence.HeartbeatLostAge, 10 s, seen on two steps at least
// watchdogLostConfirm apart, or no heartbeat at all) makes a holder stop
// renewing and kill its containers. The bound:
//
//   - While the daemon runs, safety does not depend on the watchdog: the
//     daemon fences on its own timer at most 24 s after the send time of its
//     last successful round, and a successor starts no earlier than 30 real
//     seconds after the last accept of that round (AcceptorHold 33 s, 10%
//     clock rate) plus its rank. The watchdog is the backstop for a daemon
//     that dies or hangs, so a dead watchdog matters only if the daemon fails
//     too; the lost threshold bounds how long a node renews without it.
//   - A dead watchdog is seen at most HeartbeatLostAge, watchdogLostConfirm
//     and one step (250 ms) after its last heartbeat, about 11.5 s: the daemon
//     then abandons the key (no further renewal) and kills the containers
//     with no grace. The kill therefore precedes both its own 24 s timer and
//     any successor start, which needs 30 s after the last accept (scenario
//     l).
//   - The watchdog writes its heartbeat every HeartbeatInterval (1 s) from a
//     250 ms pass loop, so a watchdog stalled for up to ~8.7 s (CPU
//     starvation) never fences a workload; the old single 3 s threshold
//     fenced after a 1.75 s stall.
//
// Readers take the clock before reading the file; a heartbeat written in
// between is fresh (leasefence.Heartbeat.Age), not stale.
