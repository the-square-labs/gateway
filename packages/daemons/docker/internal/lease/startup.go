// startupFenceLocked treats every running lease-mode container as unfenced
// when the daemon starts (A2.3). A container keeps running only when every
// running container of its policy has a live watchdog record for one slot:
// the node then recovers that key with the recorded deadline and must renew
// within the remaining budget or fence. Anything else is killed now, as is
// everything when the watchdog is gone (a slow one still recovers).
//
// The named bootstrap holder's legacy copy is exempt while its reservation
// is pending (A5). A fresh process always reports the reservation pending
// until it learns a commit from the voters, so a policy whose containers
// carry live records is recovered even then: a live deadline is written only
// while holding, so it proves the bootstrap already committed. Skipping it
// left the holder's own copy unowned and stopped it on every restart.
