// keep the registration until the next process registers, answer new tunnels
// "restarting" (nginx daemons retry and hold the connection) and report the
// holder's endpoint RESTARTING (nginx keeps the member socket). The process
// then lets the requests it serves finish and closes tunnels idle between
