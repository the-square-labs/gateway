/**
 * Scope implication rules, generated from the catalog.
 *
 * Every scope belongs to a family named by its longest prefix that has a view scope
 * (`<family>:view`, or the family's named view below). Any action scope in a family implies the
 * family's view scope, keeping its qualifier: `proxy:edit:<hostId>` satisfies `proxy:view:<hostId>`
 * and `docker:containers:manage:<nodeId>` satisfies `docker:containers:view:<nodeId>/<resourceId>`.
 * View scopes never imply another family's view on their own; the few cross-family rules that do
 * hold are listed explicitly.
 *
 * Creation scopes (`*:create*`, `docker:images:pull`, `ssl:cert:issue`, `pki:cert:issue`) name a destination, never
 * existing resources, so they imply nothing, whatever their qualifier (broad, `folder/`, `node/`,
 * `account/`, or a legacy bare node ID). Folder trees and node pickers accept creation scopes on
 * their own to show the destinations a creator may use.
 *
 * The frontend receives the same closure from `packages/frontend/src/types/scope-implications.ts`,
 * which a backend test regenerates and keeps in sync with this module.
