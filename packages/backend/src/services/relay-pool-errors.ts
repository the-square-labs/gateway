/**
 * How a staged Relay Pool generation treats what went wrong while it was prepared.
 *
 * - A gated refusal is a verified source probe. The relay checks the grant's signature, its route and its
 *   endpoint before it asks the Availability lease whether traffic may pass, so a refusal by the lease gate (or by
 *   the dormant registration of a standby member) proves every part of the path the probe exists to verify. Whether
 *   the workload behind the endpoint serves is decided by the lease at run time and never by placement: a standby
 *   member refuses every probe until a takeover, and failing its placement for that would keep the pool degraded for
 *   as long as it stands by. A relay without lease coordination is the exception: it can never admit lease traffic.
 * - A transient condition proves nothing about the placement either: the daemon was busy, a node or the local relay
 *   was briefly unreachable, or a Gateway restart interrupted the preparation. Such a generation is rolled back as
 *   not attempted and retried shortly, instead of being recorded as a failure.
 * - Everything else (a relay that refuses the grant, a missing candidate grant, a source that cannot reach the relay)
 *   is a genuine failure and stays visible.
