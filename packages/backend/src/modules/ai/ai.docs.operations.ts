  folders: `# Foldered Resources

Gateway uses shared folder views for several resource lists. Use folder tools instead of guessing REST paths.

## Tools
- list_resource_folders({ resourceType, dockerResourceType? }) lists folders and visible assignments.
- manage_resource_folder({ resourceType, operation, ... }) mutates folder trees and item placement.

## Resource Types
- nodes
- databases
- domains
- ssl_certificates
- logging_environments
- logging_schemas
- admin_users
- permission_groups
- routes
- docker with dockerResourceType: container, compose, image, network, or volume

## Operations
- create: { name, parentId? }
- update: { folderId, name?, parentId? }
- delete: { folderId }
- reorder_folders: { items: [{ id, sortOrder }] }
- move_resources: { folderId, resourceIds }
- reorder_resources: { items: [{ id, sortOrder }] }
- move_folder is supported only where the underlying resource service supports moving folders.

## Scope Rules
- nodes: list with nodes:details or nodes:folders:manage; mutate with nodes:folders:manage.
- databases: list with databases:view or databases:folders:manage; mutate with databases:folders:manage.
- domains: list with domains:view; mutate with domains:folders:manage.
- ssl_certificates: list with ssl:cert:view; mutate with ssl:cert:folders:manage.
- logging_environments: list with logs:environments:view, logs:environments:folders:manage, or logs:manage; mutate with logs:environments:folders:manage or logs:manage.
- logging_schemas: list with logs:schemas:view, logs:schemas:folders:manage, or logs:manage; mutate with logs:schemas:folders:manage or logs:manage.
- admin_users: list with admin:users or admin:users:folders:manage; mutate with admin:users:folders:manage.
- permission_groups: list with admin:groups or admin:groups:folders:manage; mutate with admin:groups:folders:manage.
- routes: list with proxy:view or proxy:folders:manage; mutate folders with proxy:folders:manage; moving routes also checks proxy:edit for each route.
- docker: list uses dockerResourceType-specific view scope: docker:containers:view, docker:compose:view, docker:images:view, docker:networks:view, or docker:volumes:view. Folder mutation uses docker:containers:folders:manage. Moving or reordering container placements also checks docker:containers:edit for each item node; Compose, image, network, and volume placement follows the shared Docker folder route and does not require container edit scope.`,

  'node-files': `# Node File Management

Use manage_node_file for node filesystem operations. This works through the node daemon and follows the same validation as the node Files UI.

## Operations
- list: { nodeId, operation: "list", path? }
- read: { nodeId, operation: "read", path, encoding?: "auto"|"utf8"|"base64", limitBytes? }
- write: { nodeId, operation: "write", path, content? or contentBase64? }
- create: { nodeId, operation: "create", path, content? or contentBase64? }
- mkdir: { nodeId, operation: "mkdir", path }
- delete: { nodeId, operation: "delete", path }
- move: { nodeId, operation: "move", fromPath, toPath }
- upload_init: { nodeId, operation: "upload_init", path, totalBytes }
- upload_chunk: { nodeId, operation: "upload_chunk", uploadId, offset, contentBase64 }
- upload_complete: { nodeId, operation: "upload_complete", uploadId, path, totalBytes }
- upload_abort: { nodeId, operation: "upload_abort", uploadId }

Read output is capped and returns { encoding, content, sizeBytes, returnedBytes, truncated }. Use base64 for binary files.`,

  sandbox: `# Sandbox Runner

Sandbox tools run bounded commands in Docker containers owned by the current user. They are AI-only and intentionally not exposed through MCP.

## Execution Tools
- execute_script: run a short script in a fresh container, return output, then remove the container.
- run_process: start a longer process with a TTL.
- read_process_output: read stdout/stderr from a running process.
- write_process_stdin: send stdin to a running process.
- kill_process: stop a running sandbox process.
- list_sandbox_jobs: list current user's running sandbox jobs.

## Network and Artifacts
Sandbox containers have no direct network access. Use Gateway-mediated helpers:
- fetch: read network content through Gateway, capped at 10 MB.
- download_artifact: download a URL through Gateway and place it in a running sandbox under /workspace, capped at 200 MB.
- list_artifact_files: list files/directories already present in a running sandbox workspace without starting another process.
- read_artifact: read a file from the sandbox in chunks, capped per read.
- send_artifact: save a sandbox file as a Gateway-managed downloadable artifact for the user.

Artifact path rules:
- The sandbox process working directory is /workspace.
- Files that must be read_artifact or send_artifact must be written under /workspace.
- Artifact tool path arguments are relative to /workspace. Example: write /workspace/report.txt, then send_artifact with path "report.txt".
- If a sandbox-backed tool returns a processId and path, use list_artifact_files and read_artifact with that same processId/path to inspect files; do not launch another run_process just to run ls/find/os.walk/cat.
- Do not write deliverable files under /tmp, and do not pass absolute paths such as "/workspace/report.txt" or relative paths like "tmp/report.txt" for files created in /tmp.
- run_process returns as soon as the process starts. If a file is created by a running process, wait briefly and verify it with read_process_output or read_artifact before send_artifact.

When send_artifact succeeds, do not print the download URL in a markdown table or manual link. The chat UI automatically attaches the file card from the tool result; respond with a short confirmation such as "Attached the file."

Resource tiers are low, medium, and high. TTL is capped by tier. The agent may request ttlSeconds but cannot exceed the tier cap.`,

  conversations: `# Work Sessions and AI Workspace

AI conversations are stored on the backend. Tool discovery is conversation-scoped, so discovered toolsets remain available when returning to a saved conversation.

## Provider State
- The selected provider model and reasoning effort are pinned to the conversation when its first run starts.
- A model cannot be changed while the assistant is responding.
- Changing the model later requires a user confirmation because it can increase cost and reduce continuity or provider cache efficiency.
- Persisted model changes appear as timeline events. Consecutive changes collapse to the final transition, and a chain that returns to the original model is hidden.
- In Gateway Inference mode, model choices are filtered by the user's model access and effective API/subscription budget. A zero API budget hides API-only models.

## Context
- get_current_context returns the current UI route and focused resource when the user says "this page" or "current resource".
- compact summarizes older conversation history when context grows.
- Recent conversations are loaded from the backend, not local storage.
- manage_ai_conversation can list, read, and delete the current user's saved conversations:
  - { operation: "list" }
  - { operation: "get", conversationId }
  - { operation: "delete", conversationId }
  - { operation: "delete_by_title", title }
- manage_ai_conversation never creates, rewrites, or repairs conversation history. Use the chat UI/runtime for saving active messages.
- end_conversation closes the current chat with a localized reason. Use it only when the conversation should stop, especially after the third unrelated/off-topic request in the same conversation.
- If context is exhausted, the UI can block the composer and offer to clear the oldest saved context. Do not keep retrying the same oversized request.

## Attachments And Artifacts
- The composer accepts up to three supported images when the selected model advertises image input.
- Uploaded attachments become Gateway-managed artifacts tied to the conversation.
- Tool-generated files are attached through send_artifact and should not be duplicated as manual download links.

## AI Workspace
AI Workspace is Gateway's intent-driven desktop interface. The Work Session becomes the main screen, the sidebar shows a separate Dashboard link, Sidebar-pinned resources, and recent/pinned Work Sessions. Dashboard pins are not duplicated there: use the Sidebar placement for frequent navigation. Settings, Administration, and top-level pages keep a back button to return to the Work Session.

Do not assume the current page from chat text. Use get_current_context when the user refers to their visible page.`,

  'status-page': `# Status Pages

Gateway can publish status-page data from monitored services and incidents. Use manage_status_page for settings, services, incidents, updates, proxy-template choices, and preview.

## Resources and Operations
- settings: { resource: "settings", operation: "get"|"update", payload? }
- proxy_templates: { resource: "proxy_templates", operation: "list" }
- services: { resource: "services", operation: "list"|"create"|"update"|"delete", serviceId?, payload? }
- incidents: { resource: "incidents", operation: "list"|"create"|"update"|"delete"|"resolve"|"promote", incidentId?, status?, limit?, payload? }
- incident_updates: { resource: "incident_updates", operation: "create_update", incidentId, payload }
- preview: { resource: "preview", operation: "preview" }

Scopes: status-page:view for reads/preview, status-page:manage for settings/services, and status-page:incidents:create, status-page:incidents:update, status-page:incidents:resolve, or status-page:incidents:delete for incident mutations.`,

  api: `# Gateway REST API

Gateway provides REST access for external scripts, CI/CD pipelines, CLI tools, and integrations without a browser session.
Programmatic REST clients can use either Gateway API tokens (\`gw_\`) or OAuth Authorization Code + PKCE access tokens (\`gwo_\`). AI Workspace access, AI configuration, MCP user access, auth administration, raw nginx config, gateway settings, node raw config, node filesystem access, \`proxy:raw:bypass\`, and \`proxy:advanced:bypass\` cannot be delegated to API/OAuth tokens. MCP clients use OAuth access tokens for the MCP resource with ordinary delegated API scopes; the owning user account must have \`mcp:use\`. Node config and node file-management Workspace tools are intentionally browser-session-only and are not exposed through MCP.

## Current-User OAuth Authorizations
The assistant can manage existing OAuth authorizations for the current browser user with manage_oauth_authorization:
- { operation: "list" }
- { operation: "update_scopes", clientId, resource, scopes }
- { operation: "revoke", clientId, resource }

Pending OAuth consent remains browser-only. Do not try to approve a new OAuth client through tools.

## Current-User Gateway API Tokens
The assistant can manage the current browser user's Gateway API tokens with manage_api_token:
- { operation: "list" }
- { operation: "create", name, scopes }
- { operation: "update", tokenId, name?, scopes? }
- { operation: "revoke", tokenId }

Token scopes must be a subset of the current user's scopes. Token secrets are returned only by create and cannot be read later. manage_api_token is browser-session-only and is not exposed through MCP.

## Creating an API Token
1. Go to **Profile** → **Authorizations** → **API Tokens**
2. Click **Create Token** → enter a name and select the scopes (permissions) the token should have
3. Token scopes must be a subset of your own group's scopes — you cannot grant permissions you don't have
4. The token is shown **once** after creation (prefixed with \`gw_\`) — copy and store it securely
5. Tokens cannot be retrieved after creation — if lost, revoke and create a new one

## Authentication
Programmatic API requests authenticate via the \`Authorization\` header:

\`\`\`bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer gw_your_token_here" https://gateway.example.com/api/cas
\`\`\`

Token format: \`gw_\` followed by 64 hex characters.
OAuth access tokens use the \`gwo_\` prefix and the same Bearer header. Browser-only endpoints still require the HttpOnly session cookie and CSRF token where applicable.

## Base URL
All endpoints are under \`/api/\`. Example: \`https://gateway.example.com/api/cas\`

## Response Format
- Success: JSON body with the resource data
- Errors: \`{ "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human-readable description" }\`
- List endpoints return: \`{ "data": [...], "total": N, "page": 1, "totalPages": N }\`

## Rate Limits & Pagination
- Default page size: 20 items. Use \`?page=N&limit=N\` for pagination (max 100).
- Search: \`?search=term\` on list endpoints for text filtering.
- Filter by type: \`?type=nginx\` on nodes, \`?status=running\` on containers.

## Scopes
Token permissions are controlled by scopes. Each endpoint requires specific scopes. A token with only \`pki:cert:view\` can list certificates but cannot issue or revoke them. See the permissions topic for the full scope list.

## Token Management
- Tokens are tied to the user who created them
- Revoking a token invalidates it immediately
- Token last-used timestamp is tracked for auditing
- Tokens inherit the user's resource restrictions (if the user's group restricts a scope to specific resources, the token is similarly restricted)`,
