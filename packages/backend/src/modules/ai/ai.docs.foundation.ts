  discovery: `# Resource Discovery

Gateway AI starts conversations with a small base tool surface. Domain-specific tools are discovered by category and then remembered on the backend conversation.

## Base Tools
- discover_tools: inspect callable tool categories and category-specific tools.
- read_skill and activate_skill: inspect or load one system or enabled organization skill listed in the assistant's compact prompt catalog. These are AI Workspace-only and are not MCP tools. Do not reactivate a skill while its earlier activation remains in the current context; activate it again after compaction only when it is still relevant.
- get_current_context: read the current UI route/resource when the user says "this page" or "current item".
- wait: pause briefly when an operation is pending, then continue by re-checking status.
- find_resource: globally search readable resources by name, ID, domain, image, etc.
- internal_documentation: read workflow and argument docs before complex operations in AI Workspace. Remote MCP clients use read_gateway_documentation or the gateway://docs resource tree with the same subsystem scope filtering.
- ask_question: ask concise clarifying questions.
- fetch: read a direct HTTP/HTTPS URL through Gateway when sandbox runner is enabled and the user has sandbox access.
- web_search: available only when enabled by settings.

## Tool Discovery
- If the needed operation is not available, call discover_tools first.
- Use internal_documentation before Gateway-specific workflows, tool argument details, permission-sensitive operations, and recently added capabilities. Do not answer those from general intuition.
- Use discover_tools({ categories: ["Logging"], includeTools: true }) before managing logging environments/schemas/logs.
- Use discover_tools({ categories: ["Docker"], includeTools: true }) before managing Docker containers/images/volumes/networks or inspecting Compose projects.
- Use discover_tools({ categories: ["Ingress"], includeTools: true }) before managing domains, routes, route folders, nginx templates, or access lists.
- Use discover_tools({ categories: ["Inference"], includeTools: true }) before configuring inference providers, models, limits, or tokens.
- Use discover_tools({ query: "certificate" }) when you know the task but not the category.
- After discovery, use internal_documentation for workflow details and argument shapes.

Use find_resource whenever the user gives a name, domain, hostname, image, container name, certificate name, logging environment/schema name, database name, or other visible identifier and you need the actual ID or nodeId.
Use find_resource with an empty query and a concrete type when the user asks to list resources by type, for example Docker containers or Page Projects.

## Rule
- Use get_current_context when the user refers to the page or resource they are currently viewing.
- Use wait for short pending states such as container startup, image pull completion, DNS/SSL validation, deployments, daemon reloads, or log ingestion. After wait, call the relevant read/status tool again; do not finish the conversation just because the operation is not complete yet.
- Prefer find_resource before broad list sweeps.
- For a direct URL, use fetch. Use web_search only when you need search results rather than the exact URL content.
- Do not list every node and then inspect every node for Docker resources unless find_resource failed, the user explicitly asked for per-node enumeration, or you need a complete inventory.
- If the result includes nodeId, pass that nodeId to Docker tools.
- If exactly one result is valid/applicable for the operation, use it without asking. For Docker image/container operations, ignore non-Docker nodes as choices.
- If multiple applicable results match, use ask_question to disambiguate.

## Examples
- Find a container named api: find_resource({ query: "api", types: ["docker_container"] })
- List Docker containers: find_resource({ query: "", types: ["docker_container"], limit: 50 })
- List Docker nodes: find_resource({ query: "", types: ["node"], limit: 50 })
- Find an ingress route by domain: find_resource({ query: "example.com", types: ["proxy_host"] })
- Find a logging schema: find_resource({ query: "nginx", types: ["logging_schema"] })
- Search all readable resources: find_resource({ query: "production" })`,

  pki: `# PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

## Certificate Authorities (CAs)
- **Root CA**: Self-signed, top of the trust chain. Created with create_root_ca. Set pathLengthConstraint to limit CA chain depth (0 = can only issue end-entity certs, 1 = can create one level of intermediate CAs).
- **Intermediate CA**: Signed by a parent CA. Created with create_intermediate_ca(parentCaId, ...). Recommended for issuing end-entity certificates.
- Key algorithms: rsa-2048, rsa-4096, ecdsa-p256, ecdsa-p384.
- CAs can be revoked (permanent) or deleted (only if no certs issued).
- Each CA has: commonName, keyAlgorithm, validityYears, maxValidityDays (max validity for certs it issues).

## PKI Certificates
- Issued by a CA using issue_certificate.
- Types: tls-server (web/SSL), tls-client (client auth), code-signing, email (S/MIME).
- Fields: caId, commonName, keyAlgorithm, validityDays, type, sans (Subject Alternative Names).
- SANs: array of PLAIN strings — just the value, NO type prefix. Examples: "example.com", "*.example.com", "10.0.0.1", "user@example.com". The system auto-detects the type (dns/ip/email/url). NEVER use "DNS:", "IP:", or other prefixes — they will cause errors.
- Certificates can be revoked with a reason (key_compromise, superseded, unspecified, etc.).
- Private keys are generated server-side and encrypted at rest.

## System PKI Audit
- System CAs and their leaves are hidden from ordinary PKI tools.
- Use \`audit_system_pki_leaves\` only when the user explicitly asks to inspect Gateway system PKI. It requires both PKI view permission and \`admin:details:certificates\`.
- The report is read-only: \`current\` and \`retired\` reflect persisted lifecycle ownership; \`unknown\` means ownership cannot be proven and must never be mutated automatically.
- Never use generic revoke/delete operations for system certificates or CAs: server policy rejects them. This tool cannot revoke, delete, issue, export keys, or clean up certificates.

## PKI → SSL Workflow
PKI certificates live in a separate store from SSL certificates. To use a PKI cert with an ingress route:
1. issue_certificate → returns { certificate, message }
2. link_internal_cert(internalCertId: certificate.id) → creates an SSL certificate entry
3. Use the SSL certificate ID (from step 2) when creating/updating routes through the route tools.
NEVER use a PKI certificate ID directly as sslCertificateId on a route.`,

  ssl: `# SSL Certificates

SSL certificates in Gateway enable HTTPS on ingress routes. Three types exist:

## Types
1. **ACME** (Let's Encrypt): Automated free certificates via request_acme_cert. Requires domain verification. Auto-renewable.
2. **Upload**: Manually uploaded PEM certificate + private key via manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "upload", ... }). No auto-renewal — must be re-uploaded before expiry.
3. **Internal**: Linked from PKI store via link_internal_cert(internalCertId). Uses the PKI cert's key material. Renewed by re-issuing the PKI cert and re-linking.

## ACME Certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- request_acme_cert({ domains: ["example.com", "www.example.com"], challengeType: "http-01" })
- **http-01**: Gateway deploys each challenge to the Nginx ingress assigned to that registered domain. The assigned node must be online and publicly reachable on port 80.
- **dns-01 with Cloudflare**: For wildcard certs or when port 80 is blocked and a matching Cloudflare connector/zone is configured. Use request_acme_cert({ domains, challengeType: "dns-01", dnsProvider: "cloudflare" }). Gateway creates the TXT records, waits for propagation, verifies the ACME order, cleans up created TXT records, and returns the issued certificate.
- **manual dns-01**: If no Cloudflare connector/zone is available, omit dnsProvider. The tool returns { domain, recordName, recordValue }; user must create a DNS TXT record manually, then confirm with manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "verify_dns", sslCertificateId }).
- Auto-renew: checked daily at 3 AM. Renews certificates 30 days before expiry.
- DNS-01 auto-renew requires Cloudflare. Enable or disable it with manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "set_auto_renew", sslCertificateId, enabled: true, provider: "cloudflare" }) or enabled: false.
- Staging mode available for testing (certs not browser-trusted).

## Uploading Custom Certificates
- manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "upload", certificatePem, privateKeyPem, chainPem? })
- Chain PEM is optional (intermediate CA chain).
- Expiry is parsed from the certificate — no auto-renewal.

## Using PKI Certificates as SSL
To use a PKI-issued certificate with an ingress route:
1. Issue a PKI certificate: issue_certificate(...) → returns cert with id
2. Link it: link_internal_cert(internalCertId: cert.id) → creates an SSL certificate entry with a separate ID
3. Use the SSL certificate ID (from step 2) as sslCertificateId on the route
IMPORTANT: Never use a PKI certificate ID directly as sslCertificateId — you must link it first.

## Using SSL Certs with Routes
- Set sslCertificateId on the route to the SSL certificate UUID.
- Set sslEnabled: true to enable HTTPS.
- sslForced: true redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS (301 redirect).
- http2Support: true enables HTTP/2 (recommended with SSL).

## Certificate Deployment
When an enabled TLS route uses an SSL certificate, Gateway:
1. Keeps the canonical encrypted certificate material in the Gateway control plane
2. Deploys a node-local replica only to the route's nginx ingress node
3. Applies the certificate and route config atomically, tests the config (nginx -t), and reloads nginx
4. Tracks per-node deployment state and removes unused replicas after the cleanup grace period

Certificate issuance itself is not tied to a machine. HTTP-01 validation is served by the registered domain's assigned ingress node; DNS-01 validation does not require HTTP ingress.`,

  proxy: `# Ingress Routes

The UI and AI/MCP tools call these resources Routes. Use list_routes, get_route, create_route, update_route, set_route_maintenance, and delete_route. Existing REST paths, internal resource types, and persisted identifiers retain the proxy-host name for compatibility.

## Types
- **proxy**: Forward requests to a backend server (forwardHost:forwardPort).
- **redirect**: Redirect to a URL (redirectUrl, redirectStatusCode: 301/302).
- **404**: Return 404 for all requests (used to block domains).

## Key Fields
- nodeId: the nginx ingress node this route is deployed on (required when creating).
- domainNames: array of domains this route serves. Registered domains must be assigned to the same nginx node.
- forwardHost/forwardPort/forwardScheme: backend server details (for proxy type).
- upstreamKind: manual, docker_container, docker_deployment, or pages. Docker upstreams store a standalone container name, a Compose project/service identity, or a deployment ID plus a TCP application port; Pages stores a Page Project and mutable Tag target.
- sslEnabled: enable HTTPS. Requires sslCertificateId (SSL cert UUID, NOT PKI cert UUID).
- sslForced: redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- http2Support: enable HTTP/2.
- websocketSupport: enable WebSocket proxying.
- accessListId: attach an access list for IP/auth restrictions.
- healthCheckEnabled: monitor backend availability.
- advancedConfig: raw nginx config snippet (advanced users only).
- rawConfigEnabled: bypass template rendering and use rawConfig directly.
- rawConfig: custom nginx configuration content (used when rawConfigEnabled is true).
- enabled: toggle the route on/off without deleting.
- folderId: organize into folders.
- nginxTemplateId: use a custom nginx template.

Ordinary list_routes and get_route responses omit rawConfig and rawConfigEnabled. Raw content is only available through explicit route raw-config tools with raw-read permission.

## Maintenance Mode
- Maintenance mode is available for enabled managed routes that are not using raw config. It keeps the configured HTTP/HTTPS vhosts but returns HTTP 503 and pauses managed health checks until maintenance ends.
- Maintenance state is audited and can feed notification rules and status pages.
- Use \`set_route_maintenance({ routeId, enabled })\`. Do not emulate maintenance by disabling the route or rewriting its config.

## Docker Upstreams
- The UI, REST API, AI Workspace, and remote MCP Ingress toolset can bind a route to a standalone Docker container, a Compose service, or a blue/green deployment. Compose targets persist project/service identity and automatically re-resolve the current container after Compose recreates it.
- For a standalone \`docker_container\`, pass \`dockerNodeId\`, \`dockerContainerName\`, and \`dockerContainerPort\`. For a Compose service, still use \`upstreamKind: "docker_container"\`, but pass \`dockerNodeId\`, \`dockerComposeProjectId\`, \`dockerComposeServiceName\`, and \`dockerContainerPort\` without \`dockerContainerName\`. For \`docker_deployment\`, pass \`dockerNodeId\`, \`dockerDeploymentId\`, and \`dockerContainerPort\`. The caller must hold the matching container, Compose-project, or deployment view scope enforced by the REST API.

## Pages Upstreams
- Use \`upstreamKind: "pages"\` with \`pageProjectId\` and \`pageTagId\`. Routes target a mutable ready Tag, never an immutable Deployment.
- Pages route creation and retargeting require the Pages feature and profile plus view access to the selected Project.

## Additional Routes And Secure Links
- Use \`manage_additional_route\` for managed literal path-prefix locations inside a Route. Pass the parent \`routeId\`; use \`additionalRouteId\` for get/update/retry/delete. Targets may be manual, standalone Docker containers, Compose services, Docker deployments, or a ready Pages Tag. Compose targets use \`dockerComposeProjectId\` plus \`dockerComposeServiceName\` and are re-resolved after container recreation. Docker targets automatically create a route-owned Secure Link binding; edit or delete that binding through the Additional Route.
- Custom proxy templates support Additional Routes when the template includes \`{{{renderAdditionalRoutes additionalRoutes id accessList rateLimitEnabled rateLimitBurst connectionsPerIp}}}\` inside the intended \`server\` block.
- Use \`manage_additional_secure_link\` for independent Docker bindings referenced by advanced nginx config and pass the parent \`routeId\`. Its list also reports route-owned bindings for visibility, but those cannot be deleted independently.

## Nginx Config
Each route generates an nginx server block on its selected ingress node. Changes are applied by reloading nginx.
Config templates can customize the generated config (see templates topic).

## Raw Config Mode
When rawConfigEnabled is true, the template rendering is bypassed and rawConfig is used directly as the nginx server block. Use get_route_rendered_config to view the current config, toggle_route_raw_mode to enable/disable, and update_route_raw_config to write raw config.`,

  domains: `# Domains

Domains are registered public hostnames with an explicit nginx ingress assignment. DNS may be operator-managed externally or managed through a configured Cloudflare connector.

## Purpose
- Track the A/AAAA target expected from the assigned nginx ingress node public service address
- With external DNS, validate the operator-managed records without mutating the DNS provider
- With Cloudflare, create and reconcile managed A/AAAA records
- Adopt existing matching Cloudflare A/AAAA records without changing their target
- Detect target mismatches before creating routes
- Required for ACME HTTP-01 challenges (domain must resolve to its assigned Nginx ingress)

## Lifecycle
1. Register a domain with an eligible nginx node: create_domain({ domain: "example.com", nginxNodeId: "..." })
2. Gateway resolves the node's effective public ingress address
3. Without Cloudflare, the operator points external DNS to that address and Gateway validates the resolved records
4. With Cloudflare, Gateway resolves the matching zone; it creates missing records or adopts existing matching A/AAAA records as matched_existing
5. If Cloudflare has different A/AAAA records, create_domain returns conflict metadata; overwrite or adopt only after explicit user approval
6. Use manage_domain({ operation: "check_dns", domainId }) to manually re-check resolved DNS
7. Moving ingress is an explicit migration: the domain and its routes move together. Cloudflare-managed DNS is updated during cutover; external DNS must be changed by the operator before completion.

## DNS Records Tracked
- **A**: assigned Nginx node public IPv4 address
- **AAAA**: assigned Nginx node public IPv6 address
- Other record types are not created or overwritten by Gateway domain tools in v1

## Rules
- Domains used by routes cannot be deleted (remove them from routes first)
- isSystem domains (management domains) cannot be deleted
- Wildcard domains (*.example.com) can be registered
- nginxNodeId is optional only when exactly one Nginx node has a detected public address
- Registered domains and their routes must use the same nginx node
- create_domain requires domains:create, and delete_domain requires domains:delete. Those domain permissions include the managed DNS records for the domain
- For matched_existing domains, pass deleteDns=false to keep DNS and remove only the Gateway mapping, or deleteDns=true to remove the adopted Cloudflare records`,

  'access-lists': `# Access Lists

Access lists provide IP-based access control and HTTP basic authentication for ingress routes.

## How It Works
1. Create an access list with IP rules and/or basic auth users
2. Attach it to one or more routes via accessListId
3. Nginx enforces the rules on every request to those routes

## IP Rules
- Array of rules: { type: "allow"|"deny", value: "CIDR or IP" }
- Examples: { type: "allow", value: "10.0.0.0/8" }, { type: "deny", value: "0.0.0.0/0" }
- Rules are evaluated in order — first match wins
- Common pattern: allow specific IPs/ranges, deny all others

## Basic Authentication
- basicAuthEnabled: true to enable HTTP basic auth
- basicAuthUsers: array of { username, password }
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage in htpasswd format
- Htpasswd files are deployed to nginx nodes via daemon

## Tool Argument Shapes
- create_access_list accepts allowIps and denyIps as string arrays plus basicAuthUsers.
- manage_access_list({ operation: "update", accessListId, ... }) accepts ipRules as ordered { type, value } objects and basicAuthUsers as { username, password } objects.
- Use basicAuthEnabled to turn HTTP basic auth on or off. If it is enabled, provide at least one basic auth user.

## Usage
- One access list can be shared across multiple routes
- Changing an access list automatically updates all routes using it
- Deleting an access list detaches it from all hosts first`,

  templates: `# Certificate Templates

Templates define preset configurations for issuing PKI certificates. They save time and enforce consistency.

## How Templates Work
1. Admin creates a template with desired settings (cert type, key algorithm, validity, key usage, etc.)
2. When issuing a certificate, select the template — its settings become defaults
3. Settings can still be overridden per-certificate at issue time

## Template Fields
- **certType**: tls-server, tls-client, code-signing, email
- **keyAlgorithm**: rsa-2048, rsa-4096, ecdsa-p256, ecdsa-p384
- **validityDays**: default validity period (1-3650 days)
- **keyUsage**: digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, nonRepudiation
- **extKeyUsage**: serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection, timeStamping, ocspSigning (plus custom OIDs)
- **requireSans**: whether SANs are mandatory when issuing
- **sanTypes**: allowed SAN types (dns, ip, email, uri)
- **subjectDnFields**: default Organization, OU, Locality, State, Country for the certificate subject
- **crlDistributionPoints**: URLs for CRL download
- **authorityInfoAccess**: OCSP responder URL and CA Issuers URL
- **certificatePolicies**: policy OIDs with optional CPS qualifier URLs
- **customExtensions**: arbitrary X.509 extensions by OID (hex-encoded DER values)

## Built-in Templates
- isBuiltin: true — provided by default, cannot be edited or deleted
- Common presets: TLS Server, TLS Client, Code Signing, Email

## Nginx Config Templates
Separate from certificate templates — these define nginx server block templates for routes.
- Each template has a type: proxy, redirect, or 404.
- Templates use variable syntax ({{variableName}}) for dynamic values
- Can be cloned and customized
- Assigned to routes via nginxTemplateId`,

  acme: `# ACME (Automated Certificate Management)

Let's Encrypt integration for free, automated SSL certificates.

## Issuing an ACME Certificate
1. request_acme_cert({ domains: ["example.com", "www.example.com"], challengeType: "http-01" })
2. Gateway contacts Let's Encrypt, receives a challenge
3. For http-01: Gateway deploys each challenge to the registered domain's assigned Nginx ingress, then Let's Encrypt verifies it
4. For Cloudflare dns-01: use request_acme_cert({ domains, challengeType: "dns-01", dnsProvider: "cloudflare" }); Gateway creates TXT records, verifies, cleans up, and can enable Cloudflare auto-renew.
5. For manual dns-01: Gateway returns { domain, recordName, recordValue } — user creates DNS TXT record, then confirms
6. Certificate is issued and stored as an SSL certificate

## Challenge Types
- **http-01**: Automatic for registered domains with an assigned, online Nginx ingress. Gateway deploys the challenge to that node at \`/.well-known/acme-challenge/\`; the domain must resolve to the node and port 80 must be publicly accessible.
- **dns-01 with Cloudflare**: Automatic when a matching Cloudflare connector/zone is configured. Use dnsProvider: "cloudflare".
- **manual dns-01**: For wildcard certificates (*.example.com) or when port 80 is blocked. Manual step: add a TXT record at \`_acme-challenge.example.com\`. Supports wildcard issuance.

## Auto-Renewal
- Checked daily at 3 AM (configurable via ACME_RENEWAL_CRON setting)
- Renews certificates 30 days before expiry
- Uses the same challenge type as the original issuance
- DNS-01 auto-renew requires Cloudflare and is controlled with manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "set_auto_renew", sslCertificateId, enabled, provider: "cloudflare" })
- Renewal failures are logged and alerted

## Staging Mode
- Choose the Let's Encrypt staging provider in the certificate form when testing issuance
- Certificates are NOT trusted by browsers (for testing only)
- Useful for testing ACME flow without hitting rate limits
- Rate limits: 50 certs per registered domain per week (production)

## Troubleshooting
- **Challenge fails**: Verify domain resolves to your nginx node IP (check Domains page). Ensure port 80 is open and not blocked by firewall.
- **DNS-01 fails**: Verify TXT record is propagated (use dig or nslookup). TTL must be low enough for timely propagation.
- **Rate limited**: Switch to staging for testing. Production limit: 5 duplicate certs per week, 50 per domain per week.
- **Renewal fails**: For HTTP-01, check the assigned ingress node and daemon logs. For Cloudflare DNS-01, check the connector, zone access, and TXT propagation.`,

  users: `# User Management

## Authentication
Gateway can enable OIDC, password, and email one-time-code sign-in independently. Email-based sign-in requires verified SMTP. Users can add passkeys after they sign in; passkeys are not a first-run primary method.
- The browser setup wizard creates exactly one deliberate first administrator in the built-in system-admin group. It does not promote an arbitrary first OIDC login.
- OIDC is configured under Settings > Advanced with an issuer URL, client ID, client secret, auto-provisioning policy, default group, and optional verified-email requirement.
- When OIDC auto-provisioning is enabled, later valid OIDC logins can create users in the configured default group. Existing OIDC users are bound to the provider subject; Gateway may refresh their name and avatar from the provider.
- Password and email-code configuration, recovery flows, passkeys, and first-run choices are described in the authentication topic. Do not claim that OIDC is the only sign-in method.

## Permission Groups
- Every user belongs to exactly one permission group
- Groups define which scopes (permissions) the user has
- **Built-in groups** (cannot be modified): system-admin, admin, operator, viewer, guest
- **Custom groups**: created by admins with any combination of scopes
- **Group nesting**: a group can inherit from one parent group (single level only). Inherited scopes are automatically added to the user's effective scopes.
- Nesting limit: only top-level groups can be parents — a nested group cannot itself have children

## Managing Users
- View all users: list_users
- Change a user's group: update_user_role(userId, groupId) — changes their permissions immediately
- Replace a user's exact additional per-user scopes: set_user_additional_permissions(userId, additionalScopes). Pass [] to reset all additional permissions without changing the user's group. Only grant scopes the acting administrator already has.
- Block or unblock users from the Administration UI, API, or AI Workspace.
- Deleting a user is a soft-delete: their access and tokens are revoked, they are hidden from operational user lists, and historical audit/usage data remains intact. Only a system administrator can restore a deleted user, and restore leaves them blocked until explicitly unblocked.

## User Fields
- id, email, name, avatarUrl, groupId, groupName, groupScopes, additionalScopes, scopes, isBlocked, isDeleted
- lastLoginAt, loginCount, createdAt`,

  audit: `# Audit Log

All significant actions are logged.
- Fields: userId, action, resourceType, resourceId, details (JSON), ipAddress, userAgent, createdAt.
- Actions follow pattern: "resource.action" (e.g., "ca.create", "cert.revoke", "proxy.update").
- AI-initiated actions have details.ai_initiated: true.
- Query with get_audit_log: filter by action, resourceType, pagination.
- Housekeeping can auto-delete old entries (configurable retention).
- SIEM audit export is a separate privacy-reduced delivery stream. Its receiver never receives full audit details, user agents, resource names, secrets, or collector response bodies. See the siem topic for its lifecycle and tools.`,

  siem: `# SIEM Audit Export

## Purpose
When enabled in Gateway general settings, Gateway can export privacy-reduced audit events to up to five active HTTPS SIEM collectors. This is an outbound push integration: Gateway sends batches to the collector; it does not expose a webhook for the collector to call.

## Safe Event Contract
Each event contains an id, a stable Gateway installation source identifier, type \`com.wiolett.gateway.audit.v1\`, ISO timestamp, action, optional actor id/email, resource type/id, and source IP. Never claim that full audit \`details\`, resource display names, user agents, secrets, credentials, raw request payloads, or collector response bodies are exported.

## Destination Security
- Endpoint URLs must be HTTPS and must not include userinfo, query parameters, or fragments.
- The existing outbound-webhook network policy validates and pins DNS addresses to protect against SSRF and rebinding. Redirects are not followed.
- Every destination uses a bearer token, HMAC-SHA256, or one validated custom HTTP header. The secret or custom header value is encrypted at rest and is never returned by API, UI, tools, logs, audit entries, or assistant responses.
- Custom headers cannot replace Gateway transport headers such as \`Host\`, \`Content-Type\`, or the \`X-Gateway-*\` headers. A custom Authorization header is allowed when a collector requires a non-Bearer scheme.
- HMAC sends \`X-Gateway-Timestamp\` and \`X-Gateway-Signature-256\` for \`timestamp + "." + rawBody\`; bearer uses the standard Authorization header.

## Delivery Lifecycle
- Audit writes and queued SIEM records are created in one database transaction; the request path never sends HTTP.
- The in-process scheduler claims rows with database leases and sends a JSON body \`{ schemaVersion: 1, events: [...] }\`.
- 2xx completes delivery. Network errors, 408, 429, and 5xx retry at 30s, 2m, 8m, 30m, 2h, 6h, and 12h, for at most eight attempts. Other 4xx responses fail terminally.
- Disabling SIEM in Gateway general settings prevents new outbox rows and pauses delivery; destinations, history, and queued records stay intact until SIEM is enabled again.
- Disabling a destination pauses outstanding work; enabling resumes it. Deleting a destination soft-deletes configuration and discards outstanding work. Only failed deliveries can be manually requeued.
- A test sends a synthetic \`com.wiolett.gateway.audit.test.v1\` event only: it creates no audit row and no queued delivery.
- Terminal delivery history follows Audit Log retention. Do not use notification-webhook delivery semantics for SIEM.

## AI Tools
- SIEM tools are unavailable while \`generalSettings.features.siemEnabled\` is false.
- Read: \`list_siem_destinations\`, \`get_siem_destination\`, \`list_siem_deliveries\`, \`get_siem_delivery\` require \`audit:siem:view\`.
- Change: \`create_siem_destination\`, \`update_siem_destination\`, \`delete_siem_destination\`, \`test_siem_destination\`, and \`requeue_siem_delivery\` require \`audit:siem:manage\` and go through normal tool approval.
- Request a secret only when the caller explicitly wants to create or replace a destination. Treat it as one-time input and never echo it.`,

  nginx: `# Nginx Ingress Management

Gateway manages public ingress through nginx daemon nodes running on remote servers. The Gateway relay on port 9443 is the daemon control-plane transport; it is not an HTTP/TLS ingress for published applications.

## Architecture
- Each nginx node runs a Go daemon (\`nginx-daemon\`) alongside the host's native nginx installation
- A dedicated Gateway relay communicates with daemons over gRPC (port 9443) with mutual TLS; the application uses an internal service-mTLS control-plane hop
- Domains and routes are assigned to specific nginx nodes. A registered domain and every route using it must share the same node.
- Each route config is generated by Gateway and pushed to its selected ingress daemon
- The daemon writes the config files, tests with \`nginx -t\`, and reloads nginx gracefully

## Config Management
- Route configs are generated from templates and written to the nginx \`conf.d/sites/\` directory
- Each route becomes one nginx server block file
- Changes are atomic: write → test → reload (rollback on test failure)
- Global nginx.conf can be viewed and edited from the node detail page (Configuration tab)

## Config Templates
- Nginx templates define the server block structure for routes
- Built-in templates for common patterns (reverse proxy, redirect, etc.)
- Custom templates support variables: \`{{variableName}}\` replaced at render time
- Assigned to routes via nginxTemplateId — default template used if none specified

## Raw Config Mode
- When rawConfigEnabled is true on a route, the template rendering is bypassed entirely
- The rawConfig field is used directly as the nginx server block content
- Useful for complex configurations that templates can't express
- Ordinary route list/detail responses omit rawConfig and rawConfigEnabled
- Raw content can only be read through explicit raw config read/render paths with raw-read permission
- Requires proxy:raw:toggle and proxy:raw:write scopes
- proxy:raw:bypass can bypass dangerous raw directive validation for the same route
- Use get_route_rendered_config to see the current generated config before switching to raw mode

## Monitoring
- **Stub status**: nginx stub_status module provides active connections, accepts, handled, requests, reading, writing, waiting
- **Access log parsing**: traffic stats by status code, response times, bandwidth
- **Health checks**: per-route backend health monitoring (configurable URL, interval, expected status)
- **Nginx logs**: access and error logs streamed via daemon, viewable per route or per node

## SSL/TLS
- SSL certificates are stored canonically by Gateway and deployed as node-local replicas only to ingress nodes with enabled TLS routes using them
- Config includes ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key directives
- HTTP/2 support togglable per route
- OCSP stapling enabled by default when CA chain is available`,

  nodes: `# Nodes (Daemon Management)

Nodes are remote servers running Gateway daemons. Each daemon type manages different infrastructure.

## Node Types
- **nginx**: Ingress node — runs nginx and manages route configs, TLS replicas, access lists, public traffic, logs, and stats. Requires nginx installed on the server.
- **monitoring**: Lightweight system monitoring agent — reports CPU, memory, disk, load, network. No nginx required. Useful for any server you want to monitor.
- **docker**: Container runtime node — manages Docker containers, deployments, images, volumes, and networks. Requires Docker Engine. Provides console, files, logs, environment, and secret management.
- **builder**: Restricted Build Worker profile of the existing \`docker-daemon\`. It has no Docker Engine socket and accepts only Git build, cancellation, and registry-binding commands. It supervises dedicated BuildKit and containerd services on a separate worker host or outer unprivileged container and must advertise execution, dedicated-runtime, and enforced-resource-profile capabilities before Repository mode is admitted.
- **databases**: Restricted docker-daemon profile for Gateway-managed Postgres, Redis, and ClickHouse only. It runs as root, validates ext4 image storage before enrollment, and rejects generic Docker workloads.
- **relay**: Secure Link Relay Pool node — runs the signed relay supervisor and worker on a separate physical host. It uses the standard node enrollment lifecycle, requires an advertised address reachable by participating managed hosts, and appears in the Relay Pool only after enrollment succeeds.

## How to Enroll a New Node (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Create the node in Gateway UI
Go to **Nodes** page → click **Add Node** → select the node type (nginx, docker, builder, databases, monitoring, or relay) → set a display name → click **Create Node**. Relay nodes also require the address advertised to participating hosts. This generates a **one-time enrollment token**, the Gateway gRPC certificate fingerprint, and setup commands. **Settings → Relay → Add relay node** opens the same flow with Relay preselected.

### Step 2: Run the setup script on the target server
The UI shows ready-to-copy commands. Run one of these on the target server as root:

For **nginx** nodes:
\`\`\`bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/wiolett-industries/gateway/releases/latest/download/setup-node.sh | sudo bash -s -- \\
  --gateway <gateway-host>:9443 --token <enrollment-token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>
\`\`\`

For **docker** nodes:
\`\`\`bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/wiolett-industries/gateway/releases/latest/download/setup-docker-node.sh | sudo bash -s -- \\
  --gateway <gateway-host>:9443 --token <enrollment-token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>
\`\`\`

For **builder** nodes, use the same installer with \`--mode builder\`. The host must use systemd. The installer downloads pinned upstream releases of \`containerd\`, \`buildkitd\`, \`buildctl\`, \`runc\`, CNI plugins, \`syft\`, and \`grype\`, verifies their embedded SHA-256 checksums, and installs required system packages such as \`git\` and \`iptables\`. It fails closed when the runtime is incomplete; do not add a Docker socket or convert it to a generic Docker profile as a workaround.

For **database** nodes, run setup-database-node.sh with the generated Gateway address, enrollment token, and certificate fingerprint. The interactive installer selects an eligible local storage root before enrollment. For automation, pass --storage-root <path> and --yes; database nodes always run the restricted docker-daemon profile as root. Before enrollment, the installer verifies the local Docker Engine and the complete fixed-size ext4 image lifecycle, including loop attach, mount/write, growth, resize, unmount, and detach. An LXC host must receive loop-control, a loop-device pool, and mount permission from its outer host; there is no unbounded-volume fallback.

For **monitoring** nodes:
\`\`\`bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/wiolett-industries/gateway/releases/latest/download/setup-monitoring-node.sh | sudo bash -s -- \\
  --gateway <gateway-host>:9443 --token <enrollment-token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>
\`\`\`

The setup script:
1. Downloads the daemon binary to \`/usr/local/bin/<type>-daemon\`
2. On a fresh generic Docker node, preflights and attempts to install the optional Secure Runtime before enrollment. Database-profile nodes skip this generic-workload runtime.
3. Creates config at \`/etc/<type>-daemon/config.yaml\` with the gateway address, token, and certificate fingerprint
4. Creates a systemd service and enables it
5. Starts the daemon — it connects to the gateway and completes mTLS enrollment automatically

### Step 3: Verify connection
The node status changes from **pending** to **online** in the Nodes list once the daemon connects. The enrollment token is invalidated after first use.

## Assistant Tools
- list_nodes: list daemon nodes visible to the current user.
- get_node: inspect one node.
- execute_node_console_command: run one argv-style command on a node console. Use { nodeId, command: ["sh","-lc","..."] }. This is destructive, requires nodes:console, is available to MCP only when that OAuth scope is explicitly granted, and catastrophic patterns such as rm -rf / are blocked.
- create_node, rename_node, delete_node: manage node records.
- manage_node_config: read/update/test nginx node config. Use { operation: "read"|"update"|"test", nodeId, content? }. read requires nodes:config:view:<nodeId>; update/test require nodes:config:edit:<nodeId>. This tool is browser-session-only and is not available to MCP tokens.
- manage_node_file: manage node filesystem paths. This tool is browser-session-only and is not available to MCP tokens.

### Alternative: Manual installation
If you cannot use the setup script, you can install manually. Database nodes are the exception: they use docker-daemon in its databases profile and require the database installer storage preflight.
1. Download the daemon binary and place it at \`/usr/local/bin/<type>-daemon\`
2. Run: \`<type>-daemon install --gateway <host>:9443 --token <token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>\`
   This creates the config file and systemd service automatically.
3. Enable and start: \`systemctl enable --now <type>-daemon\`

## Connection & Communication
- Daemons connect to the gateway via **gRPC on port 9443** with mutual TLS (mTLS).
- The gateway pushes commands to daemons: apply config, deploy certs, health check, log streaming, exec, etc.
- The daemon sends back: health reports (every 30s), command results, log entries, exec output.
- Daemons auto-reconnect on disconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 60s).
- mTLS certificates auto-renew when within 7 days of expiry.

## Console (Interactive Shell)
All node types support an interactive console — a PTY shell session on the host OS.
- Accessed via the **Console** tab on the node detail page.
- Requires \`nodes:console\` scope.
- Supports popout window, reconnection with output replay, and terminal resize.
- Shell auto-detected from \`/etc/shells\` (prefers bash > zsh > ash > sh).
- Can be configured to run as a specific OS user via \`console.user\` in daemon config.
- The assistant has a separate one-shot \`execute_node_console_command\` tool for command execution when regular Gateway read/manage tools cannot answer the request. Prefer argv commands such as \`["sh","-lc","systemctl status nginx"]\`.
- Treat every console command as destructive: risky commands require explicit approval and obviously host-breaking commands are blocked before reaching the daemon.
- Use console tools for host-level inspection or repair only after identifying the exact node with get_current_context or find_resource. Do not guess node IDs from chat text.

## System Information
Daemons report hardware/OS info on registration:
- CPU model, core count, architecture (amd64, arm64)
- Kernel version, hostname, OS info
- Uptime, file descriptor usage
- Disk mounts with usage percentages
- Network interfaces with RX/TX stats

## Monitoring & Health
- **Health reports** (every 30s): CPU%, memory, disk, load average, swap, network I/O, open FDs.
- Daemons report localIpAddresses and publicIpAddresses. Docker nodes may set serviceAddress explicitly; otherwise Gateway uses the first reported local address and then a public address for cross-node/proxy-upstream traffic.
- **Nginx nodes** additionally report: nginx status, uptime, worker count, error rates (4xx/5xx), stub status stats.
- **Docker nodes** additionally report: container count (running/stopped/total), per-container CPU/memory/network stats, Docker version.
- Generic Docker nodes report Secure Runtime state, version, setup progress, and compatibility. Existing nodes expose manual Setup in Node Details to administrators with \`admin:update\`; do not attempt remote installation through a console unless the user explicitly asks for host-level repair.
- **Traffic stats** (nginx only): parsed from access logs — status code distribution, response times.
- Background polling at 10s intervals; 5s when a user is actively viewing the node detail page.

## Node Management
- **Rename**: change display name (does not affect hostname).
- **Delete**: removes the node from Gateway. The daemon will fail to reconnect (mTLS cert becomes invalid).
- **Pin to sidebar**: quick-access link in the sidebar navigation.
- **Default node**: one nginx node can be marked as default — used for proxy operations when no specific node is selected.

## Key Fields
- id, hostname, displayName, type, status (pending/online/offline/error)
- serviceAddress (optional Docker reachability override)
- lastSeenAt, capabilities (daemon version, features, system info)
- certificateSerial (mTLS cert), enrollmentTokenHash
- metadata (extensible metadata object)`,
