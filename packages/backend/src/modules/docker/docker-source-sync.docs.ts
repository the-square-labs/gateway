The head is resolved with the connector credentials and recorded as the desired commit; a `poll` build is queued only when the source builds automatically and the head changed or has no build yet. Returns `{ source, changed, build }` (`build` is null when nothing was queued). Within about 10 seconds of the previous poll or sync the current state is returned without asking the Git provider. Requires the same scope as a manual build; no integrations:<provider>:use is needed.';
