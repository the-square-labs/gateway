 * provisioning (databases today, object storage later) that are common

 * `database_connections` record and TLS certificate bookkeeping that ties a
 * managed workload back into the rest of the platform.
 *
 * This file defines the seam's types only. No logic is moved here yet — the
 * context/result interfaces below mirror the parameter lists of the private
 * methods on `ManagedDatabasesService` (see `managed-databases.service.ts`:
 * `createCanonicalConnection`, `syncCanonicalConnection*`,
 * `ensureManagedDatabaseCertificate`) so that a later task can move that
 * logic behind this interface without changing behavior.

 *     (not written as `null`).
 *  2. `syncCanonicalConnectionName` / `syncCanonicalConnectionStorageLimit` /
 *     `syncCanonicalConnectionTags` — **unconditionally** copy
 *     `row.updatedById`, i.e. a value already persisted earlier in the same
 *     flow, rather than deriving it from a fresh `userId` argument.
 * A literal `null` value on this context should only ever mean "no updater
