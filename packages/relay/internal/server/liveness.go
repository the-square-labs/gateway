// Peer liveness (N-12). A daemon whose host drops off the network leaves its
// connections to this relay open but black-holed: its endpoint registrations
// stay here, and every tunnel admitted to them, and every request sent over a
// tunnel already open, waits for an answer that never comes. The rc.20
// campaign measured 13 s of hanging requests (until the lease fence closed
// the member) although the other replica served all along.
//
// Such a connection is now closed within about peerPingInterval +
// peerAckTimeout (3 s): the relay pings every connection that has been quiet
// for peerPingInterval, and the kernel closes a connection whose sent data
// (that ping, a tunnel's bytes, an incoming tunnel for the endpoint) the
// peer's host does not acknowledge within peerAckTimeout (TCP_USER_TIMEOUT).
// Closing it ends the endpoint's registration and the tunnels bridged over it:
// new tunnels are refused at once ("not registered"), the relay reports the
// holder's endpoint NOT_READY so nginx closes the member socket, and nginx
// retries the requests in flight on the next member where that is safe.
//
// Only an unreachable host is detected this fast. The peer's kernel
// acknowledges TCP data whatever its process does, so a daemon or Gateway
// that is merely busy, or an application that takes long to answer a
// request, never loses its connection: that needs peerPingTimeout without
// an answer to a ping from a host that still acknowledges.
